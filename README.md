# Postcord

**Postcord** is a project that aims to facilitate the process of creating a bot for Discord. Postcord is heavily influenced by [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (a handy tool to send a receive web requests) since they share a similar goal. Postcord has (or will have) a simple interface that allows a developer to send and receive different requests from a Discord bot, being also able to see the results of such request. 

## Goals
So far the project doesn't have much, but here is a list of things I think would be cool to achieve:
* Allow a bot to send and receive requests (obviously ðŸ™‚)
* Store multiple bots
* Ability to save a backup of all the data stored locally
* Discord-like css
